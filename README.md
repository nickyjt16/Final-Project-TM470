TM470 Final Project

This is my final project of the TM470 Open Universirt BSc.

I have created a "Lone Worker" app for use by employees at Northumberland County Council, consisting of a Java GUI and a mobile phone app built using cordova.

XAMPP is required to host the "local host" files to simualte a server being used, and the IP Address in index.html will need to be edited before moved to production.

Due to an oversight, I started to build the GUI in HTML when I thought one of the functionalities couldnt be implemented in Java, but I've since realised it can. The HTML files have been left here for completeness, maybe they'll be completed at a later stage.

Have a look around, but please do not point out any errors or suggestions. This project is a learaning procedure, and I know there have been errors along the way.
